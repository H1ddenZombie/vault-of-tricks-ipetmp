There should be 15 tricks in each category of tricks and these should be split evenly so that there are 5 beginner, 5 intermediate and 5 advanced tricks for all types of tricks totalling 75 tricks in total. all beginner tricks should have a green border. All intermediate tricks should have a yellow border. All Advanced tricks should have a red border. Each trick should have a progress bar that updates with each step learned after a user has clicked to confirm that they have completed the step. On the floating tab bar at the bottom should include the main tricks page, a random tricks button that has the shuffle icon, a favourites button, an account button and a settings button. The progress bar on any trick needs to live update across all pages at the same time. All tricks should have a favourite button in the shape of a heart at the top right corner each trick. Once a user has completed all steps this should trigger a completed notice that counts up in seconds, minutes, and hours, once it has reached 24 hours it should then display the date of completion this needs to live update across all pages. Under settings there should be an account settings page where a user can change their profile picture, username, real name, email address and password. When a user opens the app for the first time it should show a sign up/log in screen that cannot be closed until the user has either signed up or logged in this page will not show the floating bar tab at all. On the accounts page it should show a box at the top of the screen that has the users profile picture username and email with an edit profile button that will take them over to the account settings page. On the accounts page there should also be a progress section that will have individual boxes that will count up live, the boxes should be in progress, total steps learned, and tricks completed. Underneath the progress section on the accounts page it should have a recently completed section where it will show the most recent 5 tricks completed. On the random tricks page it must display a new tricks button so that a user can select if they want to learn a different trick than the one it has shown them, this page must also not show the user any tricks they have already completed. On the settings page there must be a switch for changing the theme between light and dark mode. On the main tricks screen there must be filter and sort box at the top of the screen that includes filtering by the type of trick, the difficulty of the trick and other filters such as shortest to longest and longest to shortest, and a to z and z to a. Each trick must Also tell a user what items they need to be able to perform the trick itself and the length of time it would take to complete."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will create a plan to build the \"Vault of Tricks\" app as you described. This is a comprehensive project, and here's a breakdown of the steps we'll take:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Core Navigation and Structure:** Implement the floating tab bar with the main tricks page, random trick, favorites, account, and settings. The initial app opening experience will include a mandatory sign-up/login screen.\n*   **Main Tricks Page:** Display the tricks categorized and filterable by type and difficulty. Each trick will show required items and estimated completion time.\n*   **Trick Detail View:** A dedicated screen for each trick, displaying step-by-step instructions, a progress bar, a favorite button, and a completion tracker.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007AFF` (Apple's blue for primary actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#5856D6` (A vibrant purple for highlights)\n    *   Accent: `#34C759` (Green for positive feedback)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for card backgrounds)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF9500` (Orange for important elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for iOS and Android) or consider loading \"Roboto\" for a consistent look.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup and Navigation:**\n    *   Modify `app/_layout.tsx` to handle the initial sign-up/login flow. The floating tab bar should only appear after successful authentication.\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to implement the floating tab bar with the specified icons and navigation.\n    *   Update the `FloatingTabBar.tsx` component to include the correct tab items (tricks, random, favorites, account, settings) using the IconSymbol component.\n\n2.  **Main Tricks Page:**\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to display the list of tricks. Implement the filtering and sorting options.\n    *   Create a new component for displaying each trick item, including the title, category, difficulty, required items, and estimated time.\n    *   Add the difficulty-based borders (green for beginner, yellow for intermediate, red for advanced).\n\n3.  **Trick Detail View:**\n    *   Create a new route/page for the trick detail view (e.g., `app/trick/[id].tsx`).\n    *   Implement the step-by-step instructions, progress bar, favorite button, and completion tracker.\n    *   Implement the live updating completion notice.\n\n4.  **Random Tricks Page:**\n    *   Create a new route/page for the random tricks view (e.g., `app/(tabs)/random.tsx`).\n    *   Implement the logic to display a random trick that the user hasn't completed yet.\n    *   Add the \"New Trick\" button.\n\n5.  **Favorites Page:**\n    *   Create a new route/page for the favorites view (e.g., `app/(tabs)/favorites.tsx`).\n    *   Display the list of favorite tricks.\n\n6.  **Account Page:**\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to display the user's profile picture, username, email, and the \"Edit Profile\" button.\n    *   Implement the progress section with the \"In Progress,\" \"Total Steps Learned,\" and \"Tricks Completed\" boxes.\n    *   Implement the \"Recently Completed\" section.\n\n7.  **Settings Page:**\n    *   Create a new route/page for the settings view (e.g., `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`).\n    *   Add the switch for changing between light and dark mode.\n\n8.  **Account Settings Page:**\n    *   Create a new route/page for the account settings view (e.g., `app/settings/account.tsx`).\n    *   Implement the form for changing profile picture, username, real name, email address, and password.\n\n9.  **Data Management:**\n    *   Define the data structure for tricks, categories, and user progress.\n    *   Implement the logic for updating the progress bar and completion status.\n    *   Implement the favorite button functionality.\n\n10. **Styling and Theming:**\n    *   Apply the specified color palette and typography.\n    *   Implement the light/dark mode switch.\n\n11. **Remove modalDemos array:**\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nNow, let's start by modifying the tab bar and removing the modalDemos array.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have the file tree. Now, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement the changes.\n\n**Instructions for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the `TabLayout` component to include the correct tab items in the `FloatingTabBar`. The tab items should be:\n        *   Tricks (navigates to the main tricks page)\n        *   Random (navigates to the random tricks page)\n        *   Favorites (navigates to the favorites page)\n        *   Account (navigates to the account page)\n        *   Settings (navigates to the settings page)\n    *   Use appropriate icons from `IconSymbol` for each tab. Consider using icons like \"magic\", \"shuffle\", \"heart\", \"person\", and \"settings\".\n\n2.  **Remove `modalDemos` array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`. This array is no longer needed.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented these changes, the tab bar should be updated with the correct icons and navigation, and the `modalDemos` array should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T17:15:23.680142"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Vault of Tricks app. Let me start by searching for relevant information and then implement the complete solution."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll create the complete Vault of Tricks app. This is a comprehensive app with authentication, progress tracking, favorites, filtering, and more.
